Project Logistics (Kinnect Group)



As we know, people do not stay young forever. Age effects all of us, but these effects are most often felt by the children of aging parents. As parents age, the children are often stretched thin trying to manage all the various medication schedules and doctor's appointments, and it becomes more and more difficult to keep track of everything that's going on. However, we are proposing a solution to this often overlooked issue, an application that will be called, “Kinnect”. Kinnect will work as a tool to centralize and streamline all of this different information in a way that is significantly easier to keep up with. It will provide a real time “hub” that trusted family members will be able to access. This way, every family member can be kept up to date with the latest scheduling and medication information so that everything stays consistent.

The three core requirements of the application are the following:

Shared log of medication so that each relevant family member can mark if a medication was administered to prevent conflicting records. They will be able to track this by creating a timestamp along with the name of the family member who administered the medication.

Calendar for appointments/important events that family members can collaborate on, where appoints can be added and marked off according to what is needed. Additionally, appointment information such as the doctor's name, purpose and location of each appointment can be tracked here for greater convenience and streamlining. After each visit, a summary of what took place will be uploaded here for every family member to view.

Vitals tracker that centralizes and tracks vitals data over time in order to track trends, which will be displayed in a chart.
